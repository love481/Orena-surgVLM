"""Foreign object type definitions for the FOCUS dataset(s) and challenge.

This module defines the :class:`FOType` descriptor and ships predefined instances for the
ten core object classes used in the dataset and challenge.

NOTE: During the test phase additional foreign object types are possible. They will be provided as
part of the available meta data.

Usage::

    from focus import SPONGE, CLIP, MESH, FOType, FO_DEFINITION

    SPONGE.name                    # "Sponge"
    SPONGE.description             # Full description
    FOType.by_name("Clip")         # Look up by display name
    FOType.by_slug("mesh")         # Look up by machine-friendly ID
    FOType.all_defaults()          # tuple of all 10 predefined types
    FOType.names()                 # display names

FO_DEFINITION = """
A foreign object (FO) is any object fully introduced into the patient's body
cavity during surgery that must be retrieved or accounted for. Importantly,
standard surgical instruments that remain connected to the external environment
(e.g., graspers, scissors, trocars, staplers, cameras) are not considered foreign
objects. Furthermore, we exclude detachable parts of surgical instruments,
particularly anvil components of staplers.
